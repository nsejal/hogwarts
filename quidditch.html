      "The most popular sport in the
      magical world"</h1>

  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Quidditch (formerly known as Kwidditch and Cuaditch) is a wizarding sport played on broomsticks. It is the most
      popular game and most well-known game among wizards and witches
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of the game is to score more points than your opponents. Each goal is worth ten points and catching the
      Golden Snitch is worth one-hundred and fifty points. The game ends when the Snitch is caught or an agreement is
      reached between the captains of both teams. Some games can go on for many days if the Snitch is not caught
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <p>
      <h1>History</h1>
      While Quidditch was the first (and so far, only) broomstick-based game to attain near-worldwide popularity amongst
      the wizarding people, it was certainly not the first broomstick game. In truth, Quidditch probably owes a debt to
      a number of its forerunners in making it what it is today. All of these archaic broom games were popular in
      localised areas, but none had the vast appeal that Quidditch today has. The beauty of Quidditch was that it took
      the best aspects of all its predecessors, added its own unique twists, and ended up as a game that would remain
      popular with the masses for centuries.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <p>
      <h1>
        Evolution of the game
      </h1>
      <p>
        The sport of Quidditch gets its name from Queerditch Marsh, the location of the first ever recorded game. A
        witch by the name of Gertie Keddle lived on the edge of the marsh around the year 1050 and recorded what she saw
        in a diary that survives to this day. Successive entries in her journal show the evolution of the game and how
        each element was introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her first note simply records her annoyance at a number of people playing a game with a ball whilst flying their
        broomsticks above the marsh. When the ball landed in her cabbage patch, she confiscated it and then hexed the
        man who asked for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second entry shows that the players did not give up, but had made themselves a new ball and were then trying
        to score goals by throwing it through trees at the end of the marsh. This was the earliest incarnation of the
        Quaffle and the scoring hoops of today.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third entry notes the introduction of flying rocks that had been bewitched to knock the players off their
        broomsticks, which were the forerunners of the Bludgers. She also mentioned the presence of a "big Scottish
        warlock" who may have been a Creaothceann player, which would show a clear link between the two sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        With historical records of the time being rather limited, there is no further mention of Quidditch until a
        hundred years later, around 1150. A letter sent from a wizard called Goodwin Kneen to his Norwegian cousin Olaf
        survives from this time and gives a clear indication of how far the game had come. It had gained a name
        (although it was spelt "Kwidditch" at this time) and a number of organised teams, as well as titles for players
        and equipment. From the letter it can be seen that early Chasers were known as "Catchers", and the Bludger began
        its life as the "Blooder".
      </p>
      <p>
        Kneen's letter also revealed a new innovation: using three barrels mounted on stilts to use as the goals. This
        was undoubtedly a massive improvement from using trees as the goals and is a clear precursor to the hoops used
        in the modern game. Therefore it can be seen that the sport of "Kwidditch" played by Kneen was already very
        similar to the game as it is played today.

      <h1>Quidditch pitches</h1>
      <h3>
        "Zacharias Mumps describes the fourteenth-century pitch as oval-shaped, five hundred feet long and a hundred and
        eighty feet wide with a small central circle (approximately two feet in diameter) in the middle."
      </h3>
      <img src="image/page111.jpg" align="right">
      <p>
        Quidditch pitches are typically in the shape of an oval, five-hundred feet long and one-hundred and eighty feet
        wide, with a small central circle of approximately two feet in diameter, from which all the balls are released
        at the start of the game. At each end there are three hooped goal posts of different heights, surrounded by a
        scoring area. As Quidditch is an aerial sport, Quidditch pitches usually feature spectator seating at high
        vantage points, whether in towers (such as at Hogwarts) or in a fully-encircling platform style (such as the
        British stadium that held the 1994 Quidditch World Cup).
      </p>
      <p>
        The three hooped goal posts that are used nowadays, were originally barrel-goals in the Sport of Warl's time. At
        the time of the introduction of the scoring area, they were replaced by baskets on stilts, but whilst these were
        practical, they did carry an inherent problem: there was no size restriction on the baskets, which differed
        dramatically from pitch to pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="image/page112.jpg" align="left">By 1620, scoring areas had been added at each end of the pitch, and an
        additional rule in the game, a 'stooging penalty', meant that only one Chaser was allowed in these areas at any
        given time, as noted in Quintius Umfraville's book The Noble Sport of Warlocks. In addition, the size of the
        baskets themselves had reduced considerably, although there was still a certain amount of variation between
        pitches. Regulations were finally introduced in 1883 which replaced the baskets with hoops of a fixed size, and
        the modern Quidditch pitch was complete. Both these changes caused a considerable amount of controversy, which
        resulted in riots and threats against the minister.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quidditch pitches are built in places where they will not attract Muggle attention. This began in 1398 when the
        wizard Zacharias Mumps emphasised the need for anti-Muggle security while playing the game: "Choose areas of
        deserted moorland far from Muggle habitations and make sure that you cannot be seen once you take off on your
        brooms. Muggle-repelling charms are useful if you are setting up a permanent pitch. It is advisable, too, to
        play at night." The advice of Mumps must not have always been followed as in 1362, the Wizards' Council outlawed
        playing Quidditch within fifty miles of a known Muggle town. This was amended in 1368, possibly due to growing
        popularity of the game. This amendment made the playing of the sport within one-hundred miles of a Muggle town
        illegal, famously worded as not to play "anywhere near any place where there is the slightest chance a Muggle is
        watching or we'll see how well you can play while chained to a dungeon wall."
      </p>
      <p>
        The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692 made all Ministries of Magic responsible for the
        consequences of magical sports in their territories. The Department of Magical Games and Sports was created for
        this purpose. Quidditch teams that flouted Ministry guidelines were disbanded. One such instance was the
        Banchory Bangers.

    <p>
      <h1>Positions</h1>
      <p>
        The game is played by two teams of seven people (three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker) and
        involves four balls (a Quaffle, two Bludgers, and a Golden Snitch).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Keeper guards the goalposts, while the three Chasers score goals with the Quaffle by tossing it into one of
        the opposing team's three goal posts. The two Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team and hit the
        Bludgers towards the opposing team, and the Seeker catches the Golden Snitch to end the game. The team whose
        Seeker catches the Snitch is awarded 150 points, but this does not necessarily mean they will win if the other
        team still has more points after the Snitch is caught.
      </p>

      <h1>Equipment</h1>
      <h3>Quidditch gloves</h3>
      <img src="image/page113.jpg" align="left">

      Quidditch gloves are worn by players in all positions during Quidditch matches. They are arm-length gloves that
      provide protection for their wearer's hands, fingers, wrists and lower arms. They also provide extra grip for
      holding the Quaffle or Snitch and for holding Beater's bats.
      <br><br><br>
      <h3>Beaters bat</h3>
      <img src="image/page114.jpg" align="left">
      The Beater's bat is a piece of Quidditch equipment used by Beaters, in the game of Quidditch, to hit Bludgers away
      from their own team members and towards players on the other team. The bats are magically reinforced to give them
      greater strength
      <br><br><br>
      <h3>Quaffle</h3>
      <img src="image/page115.jpg" align="left">
      A Quaffle is a ball used in the wizarding game of Quidditch. It is approximately the size of a football.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
      <h3>Bludger</h3>
      <img src="image/page116.jpg" align="left">
      A Bludger is a black iron ball used in the wizarding sport of Quidditch. It is ten inches in diameter. There are
      two Bludgers used in every match, which are bewitched to fly around and try to knock the players off of their
      broomsticks. It is the Beaters' job to protect their teammates from the Bludgers and at the same time aim them
      towards the opposing players.
      <br><br><br>
      <h3>Broomstick</h3>
      <img src="image/page117.jpg" align="left">
      Broomsticks, also known as brooms, are one of the means employed by wizards and witches to transport themselves
      between locations. Wizarding broomsticks, unlike non-magical brooms, are enchanted to fly, allowing for a witch or
      wizard to travel to their destination through the air, as well as for playing broom games such as Quidditch.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <h3>Golden Snitch</h3>
      <img src="image/page118.jpg" align="left">
      The Golden Snitch, often simply called the Snitch, is the third and smallest ball used in Quidditch. It is a
      walnut-sized gold-coloured sphere with silver wings. It flies around the Quidditch field at high speeds, sometimes
      pausing and hovering in place. The Seeker's goal is to catch the Snitch before the other team's seeker, which is
      worth one-hundred and fifty points. The game can only end when the Snitch has been caught, or by mutual agreement
      of the two teams' Captains; the latter is very rare, however, as one team would have to lose.
