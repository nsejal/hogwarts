      Hogwarts was founded by two wizards and two witches
    </h1>

    <p>
      At some point in the tenth century, four of the greatest witches and wizards that ever lived founded Hogwarts
      School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Their names were Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and
      Salazar Slytherin. Their reason for doing so was because they had the ‘selfsame yearning, to make the world’s
      best magic school’, and once they did, each created their own house to represent a personality and skill that
      they wanted to nurture. Gryffindor students embodied bravery and chivalry; Ravenclaw, intelligence and wit;
      Hufflepuff, loyalty and fair play; and Slytherin, the values of being sly and cunning.
    </p>

    <h1>
      It was built in Scotland, away from Muggle eyes
    </h1>
    <p>
      The tenth century was a dangerous time for witches and wizards, who were being persecuted by Muggles hostile to
      magic. Therefore, Hogwarts was built somewhere in the Scottish Highlands, and concealed with numerous charms and
      spells to make it impossible for Muggles to trespass. For instead of an enormous school, any passing Muggle
      would only see ruins and signs warning them of danger.
